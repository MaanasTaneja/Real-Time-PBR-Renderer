# Real Time Physically Based Renderer with an IBL Pipeline. 
![Engine Showcase]("engine.PNG")
## Overview

This an OpenGL project I created during High School that showcases an Image Based Lighting (IBL) and Physically Based Rendering engine using the Cook Torrance BRDF implementation following closely LearnOpengl and SÃ©bastien Lagarde's "Moving Frostbite to PBR" paper from SIGGRAPH 2014. Also features a Bullet Physics integration that is used to simulate a rigid body simulation of the created entities in the scene. Post processor which can be used to create complex post-processing effects, however here I only use it to tone map the render to ACES colorspace and a terrain generator/renderer.
Finally, I created a small sample game to showcase all the features of the engine.

Other Additions - 

## Terrain Renderer

Dynamically generating vertex points at runtime, the terrain renderer creates a dynamic landscape with texture and normal coordinates calculated on the fly. Utilizing Perlin noise, Simplex noise, and other noise functions, the terrain's elevation is crafted, adding details and dimension.

## Particle System 

A simple particle system that can animate particle scale, rotation, and translation, with different kinds of emitters.  

## Game Showcase

- **Dynamic Player Controller:** The player is equipped with a dynamic controller, offering smooth and responsive movement.
- **Weapon System:** A simple yet effective weapon system utilizes the Bullet Physics engine to shoot projectiles, and the particle system adds visual flair to the shooting experience.
- **Level Design:** The game environment is loaded through the glTF format, showcasing the engine's ability to handle complex 3D models.
- **Shader Techniques:** The level is shaded using point lights, emphasizing realistic lighting effects. Image Based Lighting (IBL) is seamlessly integrated, leveraging an HDR skybox to enhance the overall visual experience.


## Disclaimer

During my high school years, as I was learning to code, this project's codebase leaned heavily towards Java-like practices, lacking adherence to proper C++ standards. Raw pointers were used extensively without due consideration for memory management, resembling Java objects rather than proper C++ usage. Fundamental principles such as polymorphism and inheritance were not adequately implemented.
This inclination towards Java-style programming can be attributed to my concurrent learning of Java during that period, inadvertently influencing my approach to C++.
It's essential to note that this code lacks recommended and advanced C++ programming practices, potentially leading to memory leaks.

Since this project, I've significantly improved my coding practices in the ongoing iteration of this engine. The updated version adheres more closely to C++ standards, minimizes memory leaks, and implements better practices related to abstraction.

For a more advanced and compliant implementation, please explore the ongoing iteration of this engine, where the documentation provides insights into enhanced practices and increased adherence to C++ principles.

Thank you for your understanding, and feel free to explore the project to witness the progression in coding practices over time.
