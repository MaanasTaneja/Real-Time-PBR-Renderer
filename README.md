# My first experience with OpenGL
This program is something I experimented with a couple years ago, I don't think I had much clue as to what I was doing, but I was enjoying it so I pushed on. Essentially I've used this code base to implement all sorts of random things, like Bullet physics, a little bit of terrain generation, anything that tickled my fancy that week really. The code itself is very embarassing, would not recommend sifting through ahahhaa. I was learning Java in school back then, so the code looks quite a bit like an attempt to make Java out of C++, which is a terrible idea, and it looks extremely ugly but here it is I guess.
