# OpenGL Project - PBR Engine with Image Based Lighting

## Overview

Welcome to the culmination of advanced graphics programmingâ€”an OpenGL project that not only showcases a robust Image Based Lighting (IBL) Physically Based Rendering (PBR) engine but also integrates a sophisticated terrain renderer, a versatile postprocessor, and a compelling game designed to highlight the engine's capabilities.

## Physically Based Rendering (PBR) Implementation

The PBR aspect of the engine is implemented through the Cook-Torrance BRDF model, providing a realistic simulation of light-material interaction. Image Based Lighting (IBL) using HDR cubemaps enhances the rendering of various materials, including metallic and diffuse. The implementation draws inspiration from the frostbite graphics paper, ensuring a high-fidelity representation.

## Terrain Renderer

Dynamically generating vertex points at runtime, the terrain renderer creates a dynamic landscape with texture and normal coordinates calculated on-the-fly. Utilizing Perlin noise, Simplex noise, and other noise functions, the terrain's elevation is crafted, adding intricate details and dimension.

## Postprocessor

The postprocessor introduces a layer of visual enhancement, offering the flexibility to implement various effects. In this iteration, the focus is on tonemapping to the ACESfilm color space, contributing to a cinematic and vibrant display.

## Game Showcase

As a testament to the engine's capabilities, a small shooter game has been created. This game features:
- **Dynamic Player Controller:** The player is equipped with a dynamic controller, offering smooth and responsive movement.
- **Weapon System:** A simple yet effective weapon system utilizes the Bullet Physics engine to shoot projectiles, and the particle system adds visual flair to the shooting experience.
- **Level Design:** The game environment is loaded through the glTF format, showcasing the engine's ability to handle complex 3D models.
- **Shader Techniques:** The level is shaded using point lights, emphasizing realistic lighting effects. Image Based Lighting (IBL) is seamlessly integrated, leveraging an HDR skybox to enhance the overall visual experience.

## Disclaimer

While the project's code structure may initially reflect Java-like practices, ongoing iterations actively address these issues, aligning the codebase with industry-standard C++ practices.
